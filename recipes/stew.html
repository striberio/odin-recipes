            <li>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
            <li>2 medium carrots, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 large leek, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups red wine</li>
            <li>1 1/2 vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tamari</li>
            <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme, chopped</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparing the Stew</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine mushrooms and onions in a large bowl; toss gently to mix.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a very large pot over medium-high heat. Add mushroom-onion mixture, in batches, to cover bottom of pot in a single layer; cook, without stirring too much, until begins to brown and caramelize on one side, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir and cook until other side is browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl using a slotted spoon. Add 2 tablespoons oil to the pot; repeat with another batch mushroom-onion mixture. Repeat until all mushroom-onion mixture is cooked.</li>
            <li>Season mushroom-onion mixture with salt and black pepper; set aside.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low; add 1 tablespoon oil to the same pot. Add carrots and leek; cook until leek turns light golden and starts to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste; cook 1 minute. Add flour; cook and stir 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>Stir in wine, vegetable broth, tamari, thyme, bay leaves, and cayenne pepper while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Carefully add mushroom-onion mixture; bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low; simmer, partly covered, until carrots and onions are tender and sauce has thickened, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
