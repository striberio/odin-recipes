        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Carbonara is made with guanciale (cured pork), eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, spaghetti pasta (it can be made with short pasta too), and lots of black pepper. Italians don't add extra ingredients like cream, milk, garlic, or onions. Try this recipe if you want to make an authentic, creamy carbonara that comes straight from Italy, where I live. Buon appetito!</p>

        <p>Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta. The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot enough to cook the eggs, but not so hot that they curdle. </p>

        <h2>Carbonara Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound guanciale (cured pork cheek), diced or cut into strips</li>

            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>10 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese, divided</li>

        <h2>How to make a great Carbonara</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Cook the pork in a hot pan until brown and crispy. Oil is not needed, the pork is fatty enough. Drain the fat and dry the pork on paper towels. If you wish, you can keep the fat to add to the sauce for extra richness.</li>
            <li>Boil the pasta in salted water. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool.</li>
            <li>Whisk the eggs, 1/2 of the cheese and some pepper in a bowl until smooth.Here you can add the fat from the pork if you kept it.</li>
            <li>Pour the egg mixture over the pasta, stirring quickly until creamy.</li>
            <li>Stir in the pork, then top with the remaining cheese and black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
