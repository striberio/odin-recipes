# odin-recipes
a practice project to test knowledge and skills in HTML

This will be a simple cooking recipe website coded in HTML, to test the skills and knowledge acquired while following the 'Foundations Course' in The Odin Project. I will build the website from the beginning, starting with building the HTML boilerplate, then adding different pages for different recipes, using links and images.
