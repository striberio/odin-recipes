# odin-recipes
a practice project to test knowledge and skills in HTML

This will be a simple cooking recipe website, to test the skills and knowledge acquired while following the 'Foundations Course' in The Odin Project. I will build the website from the beginning, adding pages for each recipe, including descriptions, images, ingredient lists, preparation instructions and links to navigate the website easily.
